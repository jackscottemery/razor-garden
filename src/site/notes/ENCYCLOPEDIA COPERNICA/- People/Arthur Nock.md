Nock sits on the board of the Solar Security Committee, and is the current Office of the Executive Liaison for Solar Intelligence Services’ Special Operations Force. The man is widely disliked, but not by anybody in a position to do much about it; to his credit, he’s effective enough most are willing to suffer through dealing with him.
