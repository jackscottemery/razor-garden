Consensus refers to a shared virtual space that is created by the convergence of augmented physical reality and physically persistent virtual spaces. The consensus allows users to interact with each other and with virtual objects and environments in a way that is similar to the real world.

A personalized and limited manifestation of consensus space is known as an [[instance\|instance]].
